This project looks at the **UEFA Champions League 2020/2021 Season**. It includes all Teams that participated from the Group Stages on and all the statistics about them that have been recorded for the duration of the tournement. The data is taken from the official UEFA Champions League website, which is linked below. However, I've added some extra's like the Team Abbreviation and Country in order to enrich the project. The Tools/Libraries used in this project are: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Python, Pandas, Plotly and Scikit Learn.
