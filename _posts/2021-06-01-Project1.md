This project looks at the **UEFA Champions League 2020/2021 Season**. It includes all Teams that participated from the Group Stages on and all the statistics about them that have been recorded for the duration of the tournement. The data is taken from the official UEFA Champions League website, which is linked below. However, I've added some extra's like the Team Abbreviation and Country in order to enrich the project. The Tools/Libraries used in this project are: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Python, Pandas, Plotly and Scikit Learn.

## Import the Libraries Used in the Project


## Create the Dataset
---
> All the statistics are taken from the official UEFA website and turned into an excel file.

##  Data Description
---
> Here is a complete display of all **Teams & Statistics** that participated in the **UEFA Champions League 2020/2021 Season.**
There are no missing or extreme values in the data. The creation of the DataFrame can be found in the previous Jupyter Notebook.

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
> This section will **Comprehensively Visualize** a range of statistics of all **Teams and Season**.

### Vizualize the Goals Scored, Conceded and Avg. Goals per Game

## K-Means Clustering
---
> Teams are **Clustered** into 1 out of 4 categories based on their performance. The categories allocate teams from worst to best.

# Summary of Interesting Findings
--- 
- The best performing teams were: Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munchen
- The finalists (Chelsea & Manchester City) conceded far less goals than any other team
- Chelsea won the Champions League. They committed by far the most fouls of all teams, but didn't receive many yellow & red cards
- Real Madrid excells in crossing 
- Manchester City excells at shooting 
- Most goals were scored with the right foot from inside the box
- 1 goals wasn't scored with the feet or head
- Spain, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany have the most teams in the Champions League
