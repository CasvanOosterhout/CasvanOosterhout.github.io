# Netflix's Prison Break Episodes Analysis
---
> In this project the Netflix show **Prison Break** is scraped from the Netflix website with the **BeautifulSoup** Library. From the HTML it is possible to extract the **Synopsis of every episode**. These desciptions are stored and turned into a wordcloud to display which words characterise the show best, what characters are mentioned most and what the overall theme of the show is.
