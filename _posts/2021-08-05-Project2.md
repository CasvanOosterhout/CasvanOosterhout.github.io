# Fuel Prices in The Netherlands Analysis
---
This project takes a look a the **price of car fuel (Euro-95) in The Netherlands**. The development of the price has been recorded monthly since 2006 and within multiple categories. The four categories are: Average, Highway manned, Non-Highway unmanned and Non-Highway manned. In this project the historical data is explored and used to predict the future price of car fuel. 
The tools/libraries used in this project are: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Python, Pandas, Plotly and FB Prophet.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
---
> This section will **vizualize** the development of gas prices over the years. In addtion, it zooms into the differences between different **gas station types** and the **monthly and yearly development**. 

### Gas Price Per Gas Station Type

## Time Series Forecasting
---
> In this section the **historical data** is used with the **FP Prophet library** to predict the future prices for the **coming 3 years**. It bases the predictions on the historical data to predict a new average gas price for the future.

### Prediciting Future Gas Price 



## Interesting Findings
---
<ul>
<li> Gas prices peak in summer, while being lowest in winter months</li>
<li> Prices remain about +/- 0.10 Euro higher on manned highway stations than unmanned stations  </li>
<li> 2012 was a peak year of gas prices, and current prices are about to exceed this point</li>
<li> Gas prices are forecasted to rise steadily, on the same yearly patern as before</li>
</ul>
